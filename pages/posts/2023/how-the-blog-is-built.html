    <p>In the last few days I abandoned my previous blog site, which was hosted on a Tencent cloud server,
        because of the high cost. I found that GitHub pages is a good alternative,and I have decided to write blogs in
        English to practice my English.
    </p>

    <h2>Website Tech Design</h2>

    <p>I want this blog to be neat in style,so I decided to write all css style and write raw HTML as content for
        flexibility.I would break HTML pages to different HTML blocks for code reuse,and use golang code to build all
        these code pieces to a collection of HTML pages.Build process of HTML is through GitHub actions.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Build process
    </h2>

    <p>all the code is in the GitHub Repository</p>

    <h3>build go code</h3>
    <!--        -->
    <pre class="command-line" data-user="root"
         data-host="ubuntu"><code class="language-command-line">go build ./tools/build.go</code></pre>

    <p>
        this will generate an executable file named
        <scode>build</scode>
        in the project root directory.
    </p>

    <h3>build html</h3>

    <pre class="command-line" data-user="root"
         data-host="ubuntu"><code class="language-command-line">./build</code></pre>

    <p>
        this will generate html files to
        <scode>${PROJECT_ROOT}/ouput</scode>
        directory
    </p>
    <h3>push to website</h3>
    <p>
        the two build step above is included in this step,when we push blog html files to main GitHub
        branch,
        the GitHub action is called and pushes the generated files to the gh_page branch(we use the gh_page branch for
        deploying
        webpages),we use the GitHub actions <a href="https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages">
        peaceiris/actions-gh-pages
    </a>
        to automatically push html files to git branch
        <scode>gh_pages</scode>
        .
    </p>
    <p>the contents of the GitHub action job definition yml:</p>

    <pre><code class="language-yaml">
